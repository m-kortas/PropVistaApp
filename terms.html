        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 15, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 15, 2025</p>

        <div class="summary">

            <p>This document explains the rules for using PropVista, our AI-powered strata report analysis tool. You must be legally entitled to upload strata reports, and you understand we use AI to analyze them. The service has limitations, AI can make mistakes, and our automated redaction isn't perfect. We're not providing professional advice, and you must verify all information independently.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2>
        <p>1.1. Welcome to PropVista Pty Ltd ("we", "us", "our"). We provide a web application (PropVista.au) (the "Service") designed to assist users in analysing Australian Strata Reports using artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>1.2. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Service. By accessing or using the Service (including uploading documents or creating an account), you ("User", "you", "your") agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
        <p>1.3. If you do not agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Service.</p>
        <p>1.4. We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes (e.g., via email or a notice on the Service). Your continued use of the Service after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>2.1. The Service allows authenticated users to upload PDF copies of Australian Strata Reports ("Uploaded Reports").</p>
        <p>2.2. Upon upload, the Service processes the text from the Uploaded Report, attempts to redact certain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names and email addresses (but not addresses or financial figures), and utilizes third-party artificial intelligence (Google Gemini) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow you to ask specific questions about the content of the redacted report via a chat interface.</li>
            <li>Generate a "Full Report" based on a predefined set of questions using the redacted report content.</li>
            <li>Generate a concise "1 Page Summary Report" derived from the content of the generated Full Report.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2.3. Generated reports ("Generated Content") are created for you on-demand and are made available for download only during your active user session. All Generated Content is ephemeral and is permanently deleted from our systems when your session ends (e.g., upon logout, session timeout, or closing your browser).
</p>
        <p>2.4. <strong>Limitations:</strong> The Service relies on automated processes, including text extraction, PII redaction, and AI analysis. These processes have inherent limitations and may not be perfectly accurate or complete. See Section 7 (Disclaimers) and Section 8 (Limitation of Liability).</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts and Obligations</h2>
        <p>3.1. You must register for an account to use the core features of the Service. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information updated.</p>
        <p>3.2. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials (username, password) and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>
        <p>3.3. You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.</p>
        <p>3.4. You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload any content that infringes any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights of any third party.</li>
            <li>Upload malicious code, viruses, or harmful data.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or our systems.</li>
            <li>Use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Service.</li>
            <li>Use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Warranty Regarding Uploaded Reports</h2>
        <p>4.1. <strong>IMPORTANT - COPYRIGHT NOTICE:</strong> Most strata reports are subject to copyright owned by the entity that created them (e.g., the strata inspection firm). Before uploading any strata report, you must review the report's terms of use or license terms to confirm your rights.</p>
        <p>4.2. By uploading any Strata Report or other document to the Service, you represent and warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have reviewed the copyright terms or license associated with the document.</li>
            <li>You have the full legal right, power, and authority to possess and upload the document.</li>
            <li> Your upload of the document and our subsequent processing of it to provide the Service does not and will not infringe on the privacy rights of any third party, and you have obtained all necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws to disclose any personal information contained within the document to us.</li>
            <li>Your use of our Service to analyze this document does not violate any terms of use, license restrictions, or copyright associated with the document.</li>
            <li>You grant us (and our necessary third-party service providers, including Google Gemini) a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, temporary license to access, use, copy, process, modify (including PII redaction), analyse, store temporarily, and create derivative works (such as the Generated Content) from the Uploaded Report solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you as described in these Terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4.3. You acknowledge that uploading a strata report without appropriate rights may constitute copyright infringement. We strongly recommend that you only upload reports where you have explicit permission from the copyright holder for this type of usage.</p>
        <p>4.4. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PropVista Pty Ltd and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your breach of this Section 4, including any claims of copyright infringement related to the Uploaded Reports.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>5.1. Service Ownership: We own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all underlying software, technology, features, and content (excluding Uploaded Reports and Generated Content derived directly from them, subject to the license granted in Section 4.2). </p>
        <p>5.2. User Content: You retain ownership of your Uploaded Reports. You own the specific Generated Content created for you, subject to the underlying rights in the original report and our rights in the Service itself. </p>
        <p>5.3. Trademarks: "PropVista" and associated logos are our trademarks. You may not use them without our prior written permission.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Handling and Privacy</h2>
        <p>6.1. Our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information are governed by our <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>6.2. You acknowledge that providing the Service involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processing the content of Uploaded Reports.</li>
            <li>Attempting to redact certain PII (names, emails) before further analysis. This process is automated and may not be perfect. Addresses and financial information are generally not redacted as they may be necessary for analysis.</li>
            <li>Sending redacted text chunks and your queries to third-party AI service providers (currently Google Gemini) for analysis and response generation. This involves data transfer, potentially outside of Australia.</li>
            <li>Temporary storage of data during your active session. Generated reports will be stored temporarily on our servers to facilitate download. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p><strong>Please read this section carefully as it limits our liability to you:</strong></p>
        <p>7.1. <strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> The Service uses artificial intelligence. The Generated Content (answers, reports, summaries) is AI-generated based on the uploaded report and predefined prompts or your queries. <strong>AI can make mistakes, misinterpret information, "hallucinate" (produce inaccurate or fabricated information), or provide incomplete analysis.</strong></p>
        <p>7.2. <strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> The Service and any Generated Content are provided for informational purposes only. <strong>They do not constitute legal, financial, investment, real estate, building, strata management, or any other form of professional advice or recommendation.</strong></p>
        <p>7.3. <strong>Verification Required:</strong> You <strong>must independently verify all information</strong> provided by the Service. Always refer to the original, complete uploaded report. Do not rely solely on the Generated Content for making any decisions, particularly significant financial or property-related decisions.</p>
        <p>7.4. <strong>Consult Experts:</strong> Always consult qualified and independent professionals (such as lawyers, conveyancers, accountants, building inspectors, and strata consultants) before making any decisions related to property purchase or strata matters.</p>
        <p>7.5. <strong>No Guarantee of Accuracy:</strong> We do not warrant or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, reliability, suitability, or timeliness of the Service or any Generated Content. The analysis is limited by the quality and content of the uploaded report and the capabilities and limitations of the AI model and our redaction process.</p>
        <p>7.6. <strong>Service Availability:</strong> While we strive for reliable service, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access to the Service. The Service may be unavailable due to maintenance, technical issues, or factors outside our control.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability and Consumer Guarantees</h2>
        <p>8.1. <strong>Non-excludable Guarantees:</strong> Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any consumer guarantee, right or remedy conferred on you by the Australian Consumer Law or any other applicable law that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified by agreement.</p>
        <p>8.2. <strong>Limited Liability:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall PropVista Pty Ltd, its affiliates, directors, employees, or agents be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the access to, use of, or inability to use the Service or the Generated Content.</p>
        <p>8.3. <strong>Liability Cap:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, our total liability for all claims relating to these Terms or your use of the Service shall not exceed the greater of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The total amount paid by you to us for the Service during the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the liability, or</li>
            <li>AUD $500.00.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>8.4. <strong>Proportionate Liability:</strong> This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>9.1. The Service integrates with and relies on third-party services, specifically Google Gemini for AI processing.</p>
        <p>9.2. Your use of such third-party services may be subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices, content, or availability of third-party services. Data sent to Google Gemini is subject to Google's data processing terms and privacy policies.</p>
